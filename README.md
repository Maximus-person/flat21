Heres a rough sketch of the house;
  - camera 1 will be positioned to look north of the house (Canary Wharf),
  - camera 2 will be positioned to look west of the house (London),
  - the camera's will be linked to a computer in the same room as camera 2, cable/wireless
  - the feed will go to the computer and will then be streamed live.
```
- Purpose: There is no real purpose to gain profit from this, mostly to just share with the world a view which can be considered beautiful.
```
- Ideas: | : maybe    \/ : nay    /\ : yay
  | have arrows on the webpage to switch to a different camera
  | have a wide angle camera to merge the two feeds into one (advanced)
  /\ fill up the webpage with the camera feed, information when scrolled down

- Changes:
  None at the moment
